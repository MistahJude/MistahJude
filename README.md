### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jude,

A passionate frontend developer and a Computer Science student currently focused on creating visually appealing web pages. My goal is to become a full-stack developer, contributing to open-source projects and continuously expanding my skill set.

When I'm not studying or coding, you'll find me enjoying a good game of football or immersing myself in the world of gaming.

Let's build something amazing together!
